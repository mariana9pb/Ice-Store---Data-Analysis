# Game Sales â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

**Analyzed historical game sales data to identify market trends and inform 2017 strategy.**

- Cleaned and transformed data by standardizing column names, correcting data types, handling missing values (e.g., TBD labels), and engineering total global sales per title.
- Explored trends across platforms, genres, and years, identifying key growth/decline cycles and building visualizations (boxplots, scatterplots) to compare sales, ratings, and market performance.
- Performed regional user profiling (NA, EU, JP) and statistical hypothesis testing (two-sample t-tests) to compare user ratings across platforms and genres. Used Python, pandas, matplotlib, and SciPy.
